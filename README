Pasted
======

Pasted is a pastebin clone written in Python, it was my first Python web code
ever. My personal instance is actually running at [http://p.oitobits.net][1].

Dependencies:

  - web.py
  - Pygments
  - SQLobject

This code is organized to run under virtual environment, if you want to run
your own Pasted clone:

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/viniciusfs/pasted

Enter on Pasted directory and create a new virtual environment called ENV,
active this new virtualenv and install all dependencies:

    $ easy_install ENV
    $ source ENV/bin/activate
    $ easy_install web.py pygments sqlobject

Now you can run pasted_start.py script to get a development instance:

    $ python pasted_start.py

If you want to deploy a Pasted instance using Apache and mod_wsgi just copy
*extra/apache-wsgi-vhost.conf* to your Apache folder. Don't forget to change
paths and domain name to your real configuration.
